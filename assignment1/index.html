          1. What was the first thing you paid attention to when interacting
          with the experience?
        </h3>
        <!-- Response in p -->
        <p>
          The first thing I noticed while interacting with the website was that
          it provided an interaction hint right next to the user’s mouse on the
          screen. (This design is clever because it’s placed exactly where the
          user will naturally look.)
        </p>

        <p>
          Apart from the interaction hint “Click anywhere,” what follows after
          is “Enable sound,” which informs users that clicking on the webpage
          will start playing sound. This is very thoughtful — I really wouldn’t
          want a website to suddenly start making noise while I’m in the library
          and cause me social embarrassment. (Since most websites typically
          don’t have sound.) That being said, I think websites with background
          music, combine both visual and audio stimulation, which enhances the
          user’s sense of immersion.

          “How Frank Gehry and his team designed a monument to music - the story
          of the Walt Disney Concert Hall” is the purpose that written on the
          website, I do agree this is basically what the website includes:

          I reckon the interaction based on the primary goal is kinda easy to
          achieve, even if you are not doing anything except scrolling down the
          page you still can browse through the documented information. However,
          I feel the way of interrelating users with 3D model interaction could
          be improved. Right now I figure the flow of guiding users to discover
          this function is quite weak.

        <p>
          In my opinion, I believe this is more like a once or twice-visit
          website, due to it being an information website, not a game or
          learning website that might have a repeat routine to encourage users
          to keep using it.

        <p>
          According to the interaction time, I believe users are able to have a
          quick browsing of the website in 5 minutes, nevertheless, the normal
          interaction time would be within 15 minutes.

          I realized it looks like just an interactive website design, but it
          actually incorporates many different design fields. By listing out my
          steps and feelings while interacting with the website, I discovered
          some great guiding details as well as confusing parts. This helped me
          understand that navigation flows might not be obvious on a website,
          but they are still very important.
        </p>

        <p>
          Also, I think human behavior psychology plays a significant role in
          interaction design. Through analyzing this website, I’ve started to
          reflect more on why I click on certain elements. However, many of
          these actions happen subconsciously. Usually, when I find I am
          questioning why I’m clicking something, it means I feel stuck there.

        <p>
          The interactive experience of this website feels quite new to me, I
          rarely interact with websites that have background sound. In the past,
          most of my experiences with sound on websites came from videos or
          interactive character voiceovers rather than this kind of fully
          integrated audio design.
        </p>

        <p>
          I like how the website informs users that it has sound and gives them
          control over when to play it. This is thoughtful because unexpected
          audio can be shocking, especially if I’m wearing headphones.

        makes that part frustrating?
      </h3>
      <section class="context12">
        <p>
          I personally feel that the most frustrating part of interacting with
          this website is the loading phase. It takes a longer time compared to
          a typical website, and the “click” hint next to the mouse appears
          before the actual webpage finishes loading. After clicking without a
          response, I noticed the none obvious “loading” indicator on the side.
          Another issue is that with so many animated interactive elements on
          the page, along with background colour blocks changing in size as I
          scroll, the experience can feel a bit messy. It made me feel a bit
          dizzy after browsing it for a while.
        </p>

        <p>
          BTW, I don’t understand why they used multiple different styles of
          font on the same website. The title feels modern and bold, while the
          body text has an elegant feel, but then the captions for the pictures
          use a futuristic sans-serif font.

      <p>
        I would say that placing the hint next to the mouse on the screen is a
        smart move. This website also contains a rich variety of media, and its
        interactions are relatively simple, with scrolling as the main
        navigation method and clicking as the primary function method.
