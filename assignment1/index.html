        <h3>
          1.What was the first thing you paid attention to when interacting with
          the experience?
        </h3>

        <p>
          The first thing I noticed while interacting with the website was that
          it provided an interaction hint right next to the user’s mouse on the
          screen. (This design is clever because it’s placed exactly where the
          user will naturally look.)
        </p>

        <p>
          Apart from the interaction hint “Click anywhere,” what follows after
          is “Enable sound,” which informs users that clicking on the webpage
          will start playing sound. This is very thoughtful — I really wouldn’t
          want a website to suddenly start making noise while I’m in the library
          and cause me social embarrassment. (Since most websites typically
          don’t have sound.) That being said, I think websites with background
          music, combine both visual and audio stimulation, which enhances the
          user’s sense of immersion.

          I reckon it was scrolling through those contexts, there are various
          different contexts. Apart from that interacting with the 3D model is
          also the part that I spent a long time.

      <p>
        “How Frank Gehry and his team designed a monument to music - the story
        of the Walt Disney Concert Hall” is the purpose that written on the
        website, I do agree this is basically what the website includes: History
        of the concert hall, its design concept, and process.

        It starts the interaction with a hint next to the mouse. Users can
        experience the interaction over time through the progress bar and
        differently coloured sections.

        6.How does the interactive experience communicate this primary goal?
      </h3>
      <p>
        I reckon the interaction based on the primary goal is kinda easy to
        achieve, even if you are not doing anything except scrolling down the
        page you still can browse through the documented information. However, I
        feel the way of interrelating users with 3D model interaction could be
        improved. Right now I figure the flow of guiding users to discover this
        function is quite weak.

        7.What is your impression of how the experience should be interacted

      <p>
        In my opinion, I believe this is more like a once or twice-visit
        website, due to it being an information website, not a game or learning
        website that might have a repeat routine to encourage users to keep
        using it.
      </p>
      <p>
        According to the interaction time, I believe users are able to have a
        quick browsing of the website in 5 minutes, nevertheless, the normal
        interaction time would be within 15 minutes.

        10.What does this reference/s communicate to you about how you should
        act when engaging with your research experience?
      </h3>

      <p>
        I realized it looks like just an interactive website design, but it
        actually incorporates many different design fields. By listing out my
        steps and feelings while interacting with the website, I discovered some
        great guiding details as well as confusing parts. This helped me
        understand that navigation flows might not be obvious on a website, but
        they are still very important.
      </p>

      <p>
        Also, I think human behavior psychology plays a significant role in
        interaction design. Through analyzing this website, I’ve started to
        reflect more on why I click on certain elements. However, many of these
        actions happen subconsciously. Usually, when I find I am questioning why
        I’m clicking something, it means I feel stuck there.

        What does this reference/s communicate to you about how you should feel
        when engaging with your research experience?
      </h3>

      <p>
        The interactive experience of this website feels quite new to me, I
        rarely interact with websites that have background sound. In the past,
        most of my experiences with sound on websites came from videos or
        interactive character voiceovers rather than this kind of fully
        integrated audio design.
      </p>

      <p>
        I like how the website informs users that it has sound and gives them
        control over when to play it. This is thoughtful because unexpected
        audio can be shocking, especially if I’m wearing headphones.

    <section class="q12">
      <h3>
        What is the most frustrating part of the interaction to you and what
        makes that part frustrating?
      </h3>

      <p>
        I personally feel that the most frustrating part of interacting with
        this website is the loading phase. It takes a longer time compared to a
        typical website, and the “click” hint next to the mouse appears before
        the actual webpage finishes loading. After clicking without a response,
        I noticed the none obvious “loading” indicator on the side. Another
        issue is that with so many animated interactive elements on the page,
        along with background colour blocks changing in size as I scroll, the
        experience can feel a bit messy. It made me feel a bit dizzy after
        browsing it for a while.
      </p>

      <p>
        BTW, I don’t understand why they used multiple different styles of font
        on the same website. The title feels modern and bold, while the body
        text has an elegant feel, but then the captions for the pictures use a
        futuristic sans-serif font.
