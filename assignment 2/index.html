    <!-- Design Concept(Home page): 
 
First, I try to make it cute cause I assume this is a toturial of folding paper wind mill for kids. Due to the TA are kids I try to make it cute and friendly with round font and button. For colour I majority use the one with higher saturation to attractive them also make sure it is colourful(Playful)!

Second, I also aim for make the navigation simple start by the "Start" in the home page. I stil maintain the navigation bar on the top in case if the user wants to go the "Instruction page" or back to "Home page" But, I put the name of the website and navgaction bar at the same line to increase the proportion of the cover image. On the other hand, because I thought navgation bar usually is for the adult that playing with kids, So I make it more simple and elegance style with the colour teal, which is inspire from the video frame.
 
Last, I make the picture of the home page by Illstrator. I inspire by the items you need to prepare in the video and the wind mill we are making throughout video. I draw them in a cute way and add face and hands to make them easy to approach for kids! -->

    <!-- Font 1, I choose DynaPuff as my basic font because it is san-serif which is easy for people to read on the interface and it is round and cute which fit with fit with my design concept.-->
    <link
      href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=DynaPuff:wght@400..700&display=swap"
      rel="stylesheet"
    />
    <!-- Font 2, I choose this font as the one of the website title because even though it is round, but it looks a bit formaler than the first font, which I reckon the title and navgation bar is for adult. -->
    <link
      href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Fredoka:wght@300..700&display=swap"
      rel="stylesheet"
    />

    <!-- Just like what I leart in assignment 1, I made a favicon for my website. This time I pick a colourful wind mill as my favicon to fit with my website style (Kids & Wind mill). -->

    <!-- Header & Navgation Section -->
    <!-- I blend the header and navgation page together to save space for the cover image. I change the website name. I leart a theory of UIUX design - Make sure that the user know where are them in the webpage. So I put the name also Tutorial to let them know that this is the page teach them foling wind mill.-->
