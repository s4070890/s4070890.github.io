    <!-- Font 1: Pangolin
      I choose Pangolin as the font for the small card(omikuji) that appear while user hover over the animal balls on the Home Page. 

      Because it looks like hand writing style and in Japanese culture omikuji usually write with Japanese calligrapgy style. I try on that kind of font, however it didn't go well with English Character. 
      
      So I decide on this font with handwrite vibe to align the traditional Japanese omikuji style, I make my final choice on Pangolin also because it is rounded good fit with my animal balls(Rounded as well)& overall cute vibe of the webpage. -->

    <!-- Favicon
    As those previous assignments, I make a favicon for my website. I choose sakura as the simbol of the webpage due to it is the national flower of Japan. 
    Despite, I actually consider on the Lucky machine as well, the reason I didn't end up with the machine icon because I feel it is too complicated in a such small favicon. -->

    <!-- Make the title as Japanese Lucky Draw.
     I was thinking just write Garagara(come from the sound while you span it) Chusenki the  Japanese name, But consider that people in Australia might not be able to understand it, So I change it to Japanese Lucky Draw.  -->
    <title>Japanese Lucky Draw</title>

    <!-- Background music
     I choose a traditional Japanese style music play with tradition instruments. The vibe of the music aim to give user calm, clear mind set while entre the webpage. Same as they go to temple or shrine -->
    <audio id="bgm" src="audio/background_music.mp3" autoplay loop></audio>

    <!-- Background cover image
     First, I made this cover in Adobe Illustrator before I start coding. The concept of it is come from shrine, so I use red and light yellow as the main colour. At the same time, I want to make it cutier owing to that I have the pink background.
     
     Second, Apart from that I use the ribbon bow which is very often to see in Japanese culture, the rectangle cloud and the Japanese pattern to enhance its Japanese vibe.
     
    Third, as you can see I mask the patteren in circle to recall the same shape as the animal balls.

    Last, I choose all the colour from the traditional Japnese colour to make it smooth. I would said it kind of give a similiar vibe as morandi colour soft and smooth. -->

    <!-- The font in the image is arial round, I just want to make sure it looks round to fit with the balls. And I make the curve text to fit with the machine's shape. -->

    <div class="cover">
      <img class="cover-img" src="img/cover.png" alt="封面圖" />

    <!-- Start Button
     I make the start as the shape of sakura to show the Japanese culture and use vivid red to make it pretty obvious for user to notice where to start at the first glance they get into the website.
    On the other hand, the handle and button come with the same colour, due to people's mental expection will try to span via the handle I reckon link the handle and button with the same colour would help user to find the button. -->

    <!-- BTW, I try to align it in the centre of the ribbon, so it looks like a knot.  -->

    <!-- Draw Machine
     I made the machine in Illustor and seprate into 4 layers, because I know I will only need 2 of them apply with animation -->

      <!-- Animal Balls
       The oringle lucky draw in Japan usually represent the result through different colour of balls, but I feel that is a bit boring to make five balls just in different colour. So I combile it with Japanese famous animals, which is cute and meaningful at the same time. Each animals have their tradition story behind and I use that as the reference to decide their lucky level.-->

      <!-- I made these animal balls in Illustor as well to maintain they look like a set not only by shape, I make sure their colour saturation are in the same level and all have a bit red in there. Just in case if you notice I make the blackcat that symbol unlucky smaller, haha don't want people to get unlucky -->
