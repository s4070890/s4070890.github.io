    <!-- Font 1: Pangolin
      I choose Pangolin as the font for the small card(omikuji) that appear while user hover over the animal balls on the Home Page. 

      Because it looks like hand writing style and in Japanese culture omikuji usually write with Japanese calligrapgy style. I try on that kind of font, however it didn't go well with English Character. 
      
      So I decide on this font with handwrite vibe to align the traditional Japanese omikuji style, I make my final choice on Pangolin also because it is rounded good fit with my animal balls(Rounded as well)& overall cute vibe of the webpage. -->

    <!-- Favicon
    As those previous assignments, I make a favicon for my website. I choose sakura as the simbol of the webpage due to it is the national flower of Japan. 
    Despite, I actually consider on the Lucky machine as well, the reason I didn't end up with the machine icon because I feel it is too complicated in a such small favicon. -->

    <!-- Make the title as Japanese Lucky Draw.
     I was thinking just write Garagara(come from the sound while you span it) Chusenki the  Japanese name, But consider that people in Australia might not be able to understand it, So I change it to Japanese Lucky Draw.  -->
    <title>Japanese Lucky Draw</title>

    <!-- Design concept:
      First of all, after saw the presentations from other in class, I changed my plan. My original idea was to create a portfolio page, but I realised that is not fit very will with the assignment brief. After re-read the assignment brief, compare with my old plan (portfolio page), I found that the task was not just about using the specified features on a webpage, but about designing a website where the specified features are the core. So I come up with this Japanese lucky draw.

      Second, I was inspire by Japanese Omikuji box, which people shake the cylindrical box than get a stick with number out from there and get the luck level note based on the number. However, I feel the process of it is a bit boring to just let user click than see the box move up-down and get result. So I combine the idea of the rotating lottery machine that usually used in shopping promotions and local festivals. I feel that the animation of rotate will be more attractive that just move up down.

      Third, as aesthetic in the real life that rotating lottery machine usually display the prize by different colour of balls, nevertheless is a bit boring and not special to just display in colours (Also as I know that colours could have very different meaning with people from different culture background.) Due to this issue I had more research based on the Shrine and discover there are a lot of Shrine have their own symbol animals, so I decide to change the colour balls into animal balls with Japanese animals which allows share more Japanese culture and avoid the misunderstanding of colour. 
      (I just discover it looks like capsule toy vending machine haha)

      Last, I enounter some diffcucltly while translate the Omikuji message from Japanese to English cause Japanese is High-context language so the Omikuji message usually express in very tactfully way Such as: If flowers bloom, butterflies will come which actually means if you want to seek for job or love, you have to work harder to increase your own value. After I tried with some other friends that only erspeaks English, I discover they were unable to get the meaning behind the context. I got some advise from those friends, they encourage me to look into tarot which helps a lot. I rewrite the Omikuji message by reference from tarot.(But I keep the format from the Omikuji that give hint in different sections Such as: work, love, travel and health) 

      For the overall design, I aim to create the vibe same as Shrine‘s solemn and peaceful atmosphere. But I also want it to be cute and stressless so instead use red colour that symbolise torii I change it to pink and add some Japanese pattern to enhancee vibe. All the colour I used were pick in Japanese tradition colour.

    <!-- Background music
     I choose a traditional Japanese style music play with tradition instruments. The vibe of the music aim to give user calm, clear mind set while entre the webpage. Same as they go to temple or shrine -->
    <audio id="bgm" src="audio/background_music.mp3" autoplay loop></audio>

    <!-- Background cover image
     First, I made this cover in Adobe Illustrator before I start coding. The concept of it is come from shrine, so I use red and light yellow as the main colour. At the same time, I want to make it cutier owing to that I have the pink background.
     
     Second, Apart from that I use the ribbon bow which is very often to see in Japanese culture, the rectangle cloud and the Japanese pattern to enhance its Japanese vibe.
     
    Third, as you can see I mask the patteren in circle to recall the same shape as the animal balls.

    Last, I choose all the colour from the traditional Japnese colour to make it smooth. I would said it kind of give a similiar vibe as morandi colour soft and smooth. -->

    <!-- The font in the image is arial round, I just want to make sure it looks round to fit with the balls. And I make the curve text to fit with the machine's shape. -->

    <div class="cover">
      <img class="cover-img" src="img/cover.png" alt="封面圖" />

    <!-- Start Button
     I make the start as the shape of sakura to show the Japanese culture and use vivid red to make it pretty obvious for user to notice where to start at the first glance they get into the website.
    On the other hand, the handle and button come with the same colour, due to people's mental expection will try to span via the handle I reckon link the handle and button with the same colour would help user to find the button. -->

    <!-- BTW, I try to align it in the centre of the ribbon, so it looks like a knot.  -->

    <!-- Draw Machine
     I made the machine in Illustor and seprate into 4 layers, because I know I will only need 2 of them apply with animation -->

      <!-- Animal Balls
       The oringle lucky draw in Japan usually represent the result through different colour of balls, but I feel that is a bit boring to make five balls just in different colour. So I combile it with Japanese famous animals, which is cute and meaningful at the same time. Each animals have their tradition story behind and I use that as the reference to decide their lucky level.-->

      <!-- I made these animal balls in Illustor as well to maintain they look like a set not only by shape, I make sure their colour saturation are in the same level and all have a bit red in there. Just in case if you notice I make the blackcat that symbol unlucky smaller, haha don't want people to get unlucky -->
